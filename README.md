# Airline_Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction

#### This project aims to predict customer satisfaction for airlines using machine learning models.

**Problem Description:**
Dissatisfied customers can have detrimental consequences for airlines, including negative impacts on reputation, decreased customer loyalty, and financial losses. This project aims to predict whether a customer will be satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight experience.

**Solution Overview:**
By leveraging machine learning models, this project predicts customer satisfaction based on various predictors. The solution includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Collect and preprocess data from customer surveys and flight information.
- **Feature Engineering:** Develop features such as passenger details, flight information, and service ratings.
- **Customer Satisfaction Prediction:** Use machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.
- **Detailed Analysis:** Analyze model performance and feature importance.

**Dataset:**
The dataset is sourced from an undisclosed airline and includes customer survey scores, passenger details, and flight information. [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raminhuseyn/airline-customer-satisfaction)
